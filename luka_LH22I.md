## Takeaways
I think I am pretty confident in my git and Github skills form what we learned last year in the Discrete Algorithms class, although I would like to collaborate with someone through Github to see how it is to work with another person because I still have no experience with this. I know the basic commands and how to work it on my own device but further practice with collaboration would be nice.
